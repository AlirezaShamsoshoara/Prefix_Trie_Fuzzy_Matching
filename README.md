# Prefix_Trie_Fuzzy_Matching
Data Structure: Prefix Trie with Fuzzy Matching


## Project Goal
This project aims to implement a Prefix Trie data structure to read and store genomic sequences of a given dataset. Then, the aim is to implement a fuzzy matching method to tolerate up to 1 mismatch and find the matching sequence between the dataset and the target. This problem is divided into two independent subproblems. However, the same class must be used in both problems. The structure of the class is as follow:

* It has a default constructor
* It has at least one custom constructor
* It has a search function to traverse the genome
* It has a copy constructor
